<p>“Made in America: China in the  Imagination of American Writers”</p>

<p>Most Americans know little about the inner life of China.  Chinese fiction and poetry is often not translated into English. This knowledge gap has led Americans to have their own prejudices, their own fantasies, and their own ideas of China, often without ever having been there.  Poets from Emily Dickinson to Ezra Pound, from Marianne Moore to Allen Ginsberg have imagined China.  And younger poets still do.  Fulbright Board Chairman and Poet Tom Healy will discuss these ideas and more in a lecture and discussion.</p>
