<p>How much oxygen<br />
to ask a question,<br />
to rattle a crack-lipped<br />
whisper,<br />
a one-word lie?</p>

<p>Other animals exist<br />
in an endless present—<br />
ice and light,<br />
speed or crawl, waves<br />
of whatever is this and now.</p>

<p>Of course there’s us—<br />
the only breathing bodies<br />
free enough not<br />
to show up to ourselves,<br />
for whom, if we can</p>

<p>summon strength,<br />
being anywhere<br />
is always in doubt.<br />
Why? Why bother?<br />
Because what is there?</p>

<p>With everything<br />
our bodies know,<br />
strong or broken,<br />
we never have the luxury<br />
of making ourselves simple.</p>

<p>Everywhere is always<br />
uneasy, an altitude<br />
of sudden storms, weak<br />
footholds, frostbite, crevasse,<br />
black and blue terrain.</p>
