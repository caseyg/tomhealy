I spar with a boxer  
who’d destroy me  
if this were anything  

like fighting.  

But on this wood floor  
I am what I pretend to be—  

my hook blisters,  
my jabs blind.  

I am the sun  

in a Copernican circuit  
of sweat and bruise.  

Enter my orbit  
at risk to your own.  

My wild swings  
will scorch your fields  
and bleed the sky.  

Defend yourself.  
Defend me.
