How much oxygen  
to ask a question,  
to rattle a crack-lipped  
whisper,  
a one-word lie?  

Other animals exist  
in an endless present—  
ice and light,  
speed or crawl, waves  
of whatever is this and now.  

Of course there’s us—  
the only breathing bodies  
free enough not  
to show up to ourselves,  
for whom, if we can  

summon strength,  
being anywhere  
is always in doubt.  
Why? Why bother?  
Because what is there?  

With everything  
our bodies know,  
strong or broken,  
we never have the luxury  
of making ourselves simple.  

Everywhere is always  
uneasy, an altitude  
of sudden storms, weak  
footholds, frostbite, crevasse,  
black and blue terrain.
