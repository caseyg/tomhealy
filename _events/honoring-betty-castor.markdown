Persion of Vision Award Dinner, Prevent Blindness Florida  
Tampa, FL  

Vision screening and treatment agency Prevent Blindness Florida revived its Person of Vision award after a seven-year break, honoring the public service legacy of mother/daughter dynamos Betty Castor and U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa. Dinner co-chairs Jim Davis and Lorna Taylor asked Children's Campaign founder Ray Miller to give the invocation March 20 at the Vinoy Renaissance Resort. They joined seven others with tributes and toasts, including Fulbright Scholar board chairman Tom Healy, consultant Juel Smith and Alex Sink who made sure the Castors' husbands, Sam Bell and Bill Lewis, were recognized for their loving support. Dinner proceeds will help promote eye health and safety statewide, said CEO Joanne Olvera Lighter.
