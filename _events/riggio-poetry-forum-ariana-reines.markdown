Tom will moderate a forum discussion with, Ariana Reines, author of *The Cow*, *Coeur de Lion*, and *Mercury*. Reines' twice Obie-winning play *Telephone* was commissioned and produced by The Foundry Theatre, and presented at The Cherry Lane Theatre in February 2009. In that same year, she became the youngest-ever Roberta C. Holloway Lecturer in Poetry at UC Berkeley. Ariana is the translator of *The Little Black Book of Grisélidis Réal: Days and Nights of an Anarchist Whore* by Jean-Luc Hennig, for Semiotext(e), and *My Heart Laid Bare* by Charles Baudelaire, for Mal-O-Mar. A translation of Tiqqun’s *Théorie de la Jeune Fille* is forthcoming from Semiotext(e).
