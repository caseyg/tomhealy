I am not in stereo.  
Deaf in one ear,  
 
I am unable  
with any accuracy  
 
to pinpoint clamor  
and quiet.  
 
Argument reaches me  
only on my left or  
 
marching down  
the center of the street  
 
cleared  
of other traffic.  
 
I lose the background,  
the sotto voce.  
 
I lose scratch,  
whisper, rain,  
 
white noise, color  
if it’s muted,  
 
the good gossip  
unless I turn to it.  
 
Stories must  
circle west  
 
toward twilight.  
I have no east.  
 
I learned this  
on an ordinary afternoon,  
 
my parents fighting,  
torching one another,  
 
and the only place  
to run for cover  
 
was standing there,  
covering my ears.  
 
But my right hand slipped—  
to nothing.  
 
Nothing?  
I rolled up the gates,  
 
brought my fingers  
flat again, lifted  
 
one, then the other.  
Both hands. Neither.  
 
I don’t know why I didn’t  
cry or  
 
tell anyone  
the sound wasn’t working.  
 
Suddenly strange,  
hearing and not—  
 
I kept the sugar taste  
of that secrecy  
 
well-hidden  
until eventually  
 
Armstrong  
landed on the moon  
 
and our family’s first  
color console  
 
broadcast the Earth  
reflected in the bubble  
 
over the astronaut’s face—  
itself another  
 
television  
attached to the body  
 
of the best father  
of all possible worlds.  
 
Did you know,  
I said to my mother,  
 
that the moon’s dark side  
has no sound?
