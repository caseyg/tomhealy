**Tom Healy** is a writer and educator.

Healy is the author of *Animal Spirits* and *What the Right Hand Knows*, which was a finalist for the 2009 L.A. Times Book Prize and the Lambda Literary Award. Two books of his essays are forthcoming: *Not Untrue, Not Unkind*, reflections on friendship, and *The Rest of the World*, an examination of U.S. public diplomacy efforts to engage the American people with citizens of other countries.  

From 2011 through 2014, Healy served as Chairman of the Fulbright Scholarship Board, which oversees the worldwide Fulbright scholars program. Appointed by President Barack Obama, Healy traveled to six continents to promote peace and understanding through the exchange of ideas and culture. In 2014, the Fulbright program won Spain’s prestigious Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation.  Healy remains on the executive committee of the Fulbright Board.

Healy served on the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS under President Bill Clinton and remains active in global efforts to fight poverty and AIDS. He has also had a distinguished career in the arts, including a pioneering gallery in Manhattan’s Chelsea arts district and a leadership role in rebuilding New York’s downtown arts community after 9/11, for which he received the 2005 New York City Mayor’s Award for Arts and Culture from Michael Bloomberg.

Healy has taught on the faculties of NYU, The Pratt Institute and The New School. He has been a lecturer or writer-in-residence at universities and institutes in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, Indonesia and Senegal.

Healy is a trustee of PEN America, Creative Time, O, Miami Poetry Festival and University of the People, the only accredited, tuition-free online university, dedicated to educating people around the world for whom college is often out of reach. He serves on the advisory board of the NYU Leadership Initiative and is a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations.  

Healy grew up on his family's small dairy farm in upstate New York.  He studied at Harvard and Columbia. His life partner, Fred Hochberg, is chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. They live in Miami and New York City.
